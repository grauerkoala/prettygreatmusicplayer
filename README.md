prettygreatmusicplayer
=====================

This is a fork of pretty<b>good</b>musicplayer by [Tyler Smith](https://github.com/smithdtyler) 
which can be found [here](https://github.com/smithdtyler/prettygoodmusicplayer). If you are looking 
for a music player that's ready to use, prettygreatmusicplayer is not for you; please check out the 
original project (link above) instead.

Basically, I am using this fork as a playground of sorts to experiment with features of Android app 
development. Also, I'm trying to adjust the app to match exactly my needs. Therefore, although 
suggestions are very much welcome, there is a good chance they won't be met with any priority 
treatment or at all. Bug reports are of course much appreciated, however there is a good chance 
it'll take a while for me to get around to fixing them (feel free to do that as well, if you feel 
like it, and give me a buzz!).

Development is happening using Android Studio (as opposed to Eclipse used for 
prettygoodmusicplayer).

There will probably be a good amount of inspiration taken from MortPlayer which is rather neat
(not perfect), but sadly isn't open source software.


## Wishlist

Stuff that I'd like to add to the player. Apologies for any descriptions that don't seem to make any
sense, they're mostly meant as a reminder for what I've planned.

* Widget!
    * Lock Screen Widget!
* Playlist support
* Change file selection to not require the old artist/album/song_file scheme but to instead provide
  a navigation through any structures of directories within the main directory
    * Display music files with their tags as well as their file name
* Queueing of files / directories
    * Display of the current queue
* Full usage of tag information (very much low priority because mostly for shininess.
* Inseparable songs: e.g. if a song has an intro that resides in a separate file, provide a way to 
  bind them together so that they are always played "as one"
* Intelligent automatic and/or background scanning only for new files
* Automatic removal of songs from the database that no longer exist
* New / modified logo to be able to distinguish between good and great visually
