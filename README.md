prettygreatmusicplayer
=====================

This is a fork of pretty<b>good</b>musicplayer which can be found 
[here](https://github.com/smithdtyler/prettygoodmusicplayer). If you are looking for a music player 
that's ready to use, prettygreatmusicplayer is not for you; please check out the original project 
(link above) instead.

Basically, I am using this fork as a playground of sorts to experiment with features of Android app 
development. Also, I'm trying to adjust the app to match exactly my needs. Therefore, although 
suggestions are very much welcome, there is a good chance they won't be met with any priority 
treatment or at all. Bug reports are of course much appreciated, however there is a good chance 
it'll take a while for me to get around to fixing them (feel free to do that as well, if you feel 
like it, and give me a buzz!).

Development is happening using Android Studio (as opposed to Eclipse used for 
prettygoodmusicplayer).

There will probably be a good amount of inspiration taken from MortPlayer which is rather neat
(not perfect), but sadly isn't open source software.


## Wishlist

Stuff that I'd like to add to the player. Apologies for any descriptions that don't seem to make any
sense, they're mostly meant as a reminder for what I've planned.

* Widget!
    * Lock Screen Widget!
* Playlist support
* Queueing of files / directories
    * Display of the current queue
* Full usage of tag information (very much low priority because mostly for shininess.
